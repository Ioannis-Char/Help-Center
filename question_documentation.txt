Documentation for Questions Management Feature
Overview

The Questions Management feature allows event organizers to receive, moderate, and display incoming questions from participants in real-time. This feature also includes functionality for archiving questions, rejecting them, and showing a live word cloud generated from the incoming questions.
User Interface
1. Incoming Questions Panel

    Incoming Questions: This section displays all questions submitted by participants in chronological order.
        Questions include the username (e.g., @tade, @more adam) and the time of submission.
        Questions are listed with options to Archive, Like, or Reject each question.

2. Questions Controls

    Add Button (+ Add): Use this button to manually add a question to the list.
    Moderation Toggle: Enable or disable moderation for incoming questions. When enabled, questions will require approval before they are visible to the audience.

    Present Button: Used to present the selected question on the main screen during the event.

3. Question Actions

Each question has several actions that can be performed:

    Archive (Arrow Icon): Archive the question so it is no longer displayed in the live question list.
    Likes (Thumbs-Up Icon): Track the number of likes for each question, showing its popularity among participants.
    Reject (X Icon): Remove or reject a question from the list if it is not relevant or appropriate.

4. Word Cloud

    Word Cloud: A visual representation of the most frequently used words from the incoming questions. The larger the word, the more frequently it appears in the questions. This provides a quick overview of the most common themes during the session.
